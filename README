In order to run the code, stock data must be saved in an excel sheet and located in a folder named 'data' which needs to be in the same folder as the project code. 

*** It is important that all stock data is downloaded at the same time so that the data has all the same dates available. ***
	e.g. If I download once file on one day, the most recent data may be from 11/9/17 and if I download another file the next week it's most recent data will be from 11/16/17 which will break the program/lead to incorrect calculations 

The data must be named following the format of [ticker].csv 

Data should be downloaded from Quandl to be in the correct format

To run the code: ./[executable] [ticker1] [ticker2] ... [tickerN]

Example compiling then running commands:
	compile: g++ returns.cpp stock.cpp initialization.cpp -o returns;
	run: ./returns V AXP AAPL
